Image Classification (CNN)


Project Overview

This project builds a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of dogs and cats using the Kaggle Dogs vs Cats dataset (link - /kaggle/input/dogs-vs-cats).

The model is trained from scratch with TensorFlow/Keras and achieves reliable accuracy in distinguishing between the two classes.
